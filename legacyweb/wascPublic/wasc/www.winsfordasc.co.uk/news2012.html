			<p class="style142"><strong>2012</strong><br>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="style142"><span class="style152"><strong>Winsford swimmers at the NATIONALS 2012<img id="nationals2012a" class="f-x3" src="Resources/nationals2012a.jpg" alt="nationals2012a"></strong></span><br><span class="style72">Congratulations to all our swimmers who took part in the British National Youth and Age Group Championships held at Ponds Forge, Sheffield.</span></p>
			<p class="style151">The National Youth Championships ran from 17 – 21 July and Winsford certainly made their mark.</p>
			<p class="style151">Vicky Cunningham swam in three events - 50m, 100m and 200m Freestyle.  She swam exceptionally well and qualified for the semi-final of the 200m.  The result of this was 15th place out of 66 competitors! – An excellent result.</p>
			<p class="style151">Next up was Jess Gallimore who swam in the 100m Backstroke.  Jess had a great swim and gained 41st place over all. A total of 94 competitors took part in this race alone, so again, a huge achievement.</p>
			<p class="style151">The National Age Group Championships took place from 22 – 26 July. What an exciting week that turned out to be! Without doubt, the star of the show was Ashley Hogg. He qualified for 7 events. It is on good authority from Dave that this is a first in the history of Winsford ASC!  His races and the results are :-</p>
			<p class="style151">200m Breaststroke        – 12th in Heat and 14th in Semi-Final </p>
			<p class="style151">200m Individual Medley - 14th in Heat and 13th in Semi-Final</p>
			<p class="style151">400m Individual Medley – 11th in Heat (no Semi-Final in this event)</p>
			<p class="style151">400m Freestyle             - 12th in Heat and 10th in Final </p>
			<p class="style151">1500m Freestyle           - 6th (No Heats in this Event)</p>
			<p class="style151">100m Butterfly              - 4th in Heat, 4th in Semi &amp; 7th in Final   </p>
			<p class="style151">200m Butterfly              - 17th in Heat</p>
			<p class="style151">There was also more success to come as Ashley learned that he had achieved 5th place in the BAGCATS. Ashley certainly excelled himself and has proved to be a major asset to the club. However, the glory did not end there.  The Boys relay Team - Ashley Hogg, Sam James, Cameron Jones and Brandon Sharkey, qualified in all three events.  </p>
			<p class="style151">The first event was the 4 x 100m Freestyle. They were ranked 33rd out of 40 going into the event and finished in 19th place.  The boys were delighted to finish in the top twenty.</p>
			<p class="style151">Their ranking in the 4 x 200m Freestyle was 27th out of 40 and they finished in 21st place.  Another great swim, proving that all the extra training and hard work paid off. </p>
			<p class="style151">However, they saved the best until last in the 4 x 100m Individual Medley.  They were ranked in 35th place out of 40 but stormed through to win 12th place, only just missing out on the final!</p>
			<p class="style151">This was the icing on the cake as they beat many of the top clubs in the North West, including Manchester and Stockport Metro. A great time was had by all at Nationals and hopefully the club will continue to thrive in the future. <span class="style114">All the results can be found on the ASA website. </span></p>
			<p class="style142"><span class="style152"><strong>Winsford Summer Development Meet</strong></span><br><span class="style72">This was a massive turn out from Winsford swimmers, which all 49 swimmers swam excellent, the club achieved 41 Golds, 35 Silvers and 31 Bronze medals making a total of 107 medals won at the meet. Second was Ormskirk Otters with 40. Full results on </span><span class="style114"><a href="openmeets.html">open meets</a> and on club results page.</span></p>
			<p class="style160">A huge massive thank you to all that helped out with Winsfords 3rd Summer Meet, list to long to mention all but you know who you are, if you helped before or during the event, without your help volunteering this meet wouldnt have been the success it was. Another big thank you to Brio and leisure centre staff, in aiding us with this gala.</p>
			<p class="style160">We have already recieved great response from visiting clubs (see memebers page), on how professional it was run, and they will be returning next year. We were full to capacity with the meet, even having to inform clubs we couldnt take anymore swimmers proving what a popular meet we hold. And a big well done to all our swimmers who swam excellent, picking up medals, PBs and meet records. (see reults page).</p>
			<p class="style160"><span class="style72">And last but not least to the companies that sponsored us, Winsford Weatherspoons for supplying the water to keep everybody hydrated for the day, Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service for printing of the programme and to ASDA for supplying the lovely fruit which was delicious</span><span class="style148">.</span></p>
			<p class="style142"><span class="style152"><strong>Holywell summer meet</strong></span><br><span class="style72">Alisha Hawkins</span><span class="style114"> flew the flag for Winsford swim club at Holywell summer meet, she swam in all nine events achieved seven PBs, 5 Golds, 1 Silver and 1 Bronze, 2 meet records in the 100m free and 100m backstroke, and on top of all that collected a trophy for top girl in her age group.</span></p>
			<p class="style142"><span class="style152"><strong>National Relay Team</strong></span><strong><br></strong><span class="style72">The quartet of Sam James, Cameron Jones, Brandon Sharkey and Ashley Hogg made up the boys team (11 to 14yrs) who for the first time since 2004 when Winsford last produced a national relay team,  achieved 3 National Age Group qualifying times. The team took part in the 4 x 100m Free &amp; Medley event and the 4 x 200m Free event. Placed 8th in all 3 events, their times was good enough to make the top 40 places in the UK. (see photo below)</span></p>
			<p class="style142"><strong>North West Regional Age Group<br></strong><span class="style72">Winsford swimmers were amongst the best at this year’s Northwest Region Age Group Championships in Manchester, bagging a total of 8 (eight) medals, 15 (fifteen) individual finals, 3 (three) National Age Group relay qualifications and a Regional top 11th place, making Winsford Swimming Club the 3rd best competitive club in Cheshire.</span></p>
			<p class="style142"><strong>Wrexham Cath Ankers</strong><br><span class="style114">Winsford SC took 25 swimmers (11 from Development Squad) to the Cath Ankers Meet in Wrexham. All swimmers performed fantastically well gaining many new PB’s (which can be used in future meets), top 6 and many medals. It was so pleasing to see so many Winsford swimmers finishing in the top 6 and racing with great determination. This was a very successful meet for the Development Squad and each swimmer would have gained a lot of valuable experience of putting their skills learnt in training into a competitive environment, against some very strong opposition. Congratulations to all participants everyone did fantastic.</span></p>
			
			<hr><p class="style142"><strong>Hall of Fame</strong> <br><span class="style72">After a long awaited return, the Hall of Fame is back and updated.
