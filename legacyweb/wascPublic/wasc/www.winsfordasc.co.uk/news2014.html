For both Alisha and Adam this was there first time at the Nationals however they were both very determined to do good, very, very good.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The qualifying times are very tight and so to achieve a NQT is a great achievement in itself however we were not going there just make up the numbers. Both Alisha and Adam were going there to perform and that is what they did.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

As you all know Adam lives for Fly and so it was no surprise that Adam swam very well. After 4 laps of the 50m pool he touched home in a time of 2.21.31, just shy off his PB however this was his fastest ever heat swim and it was a well fought race, coming well placed in his heat. Adam's overall placing was 17th which is a fantastic achievement. Adam's improvement in his swimming over the past season has been remarkable from not qualifying for the regional's to qualifying for the Nationals is brilliant and it just shows that all Adam's effort and commitment in training has paid off. Adam has already told me his targets for next season, unfortunately I can't tell you, confidential between swimmer and coach but needles to say after tasting National racing the experience has provided him with even more motivation for next season. Well Done Adam.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Unfortunately I couldn't be there (Brothers wedding!) but Dave was pool side supporting Alisha on her swim. Alisha as always gave it her all and after 16 x 50m lengths she came away with a fantastic result of 9.34.71 a 3 second PB. Alisha went into the 800 ranked 22nd but came away with a 17th place, a fantastic achievement for her first ever National swim, sorry I wasn't there.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

In Alisha's 13 year old race there were 17 swimmers racing. The race was stacked with talent, many Regional Champions were there, last years National Gold and Silver Medalist were there and this seasons National Champion over the 800m was also taking part, plus many more 800m finalist, so the field was very, very strong. The course was swum over 2 laps of 750m and it proved to be a very tight and competitive race with many bumps along the way! It was clear to see from the off this was going to be a physical race with all girls jostling for position but after around 500m it was clear to see that there was pack of around 6 girls out front, fighting it out, Alisha being one of them. Throughout the race there was positions changing all the time but after the last turn and leading into the last 200m Alisha was in 4th place but with a bit of help from cheering spectators Alisha managed to overtake the girl in 3rd place and touched home in BRONZE MEDAL position, 2 seconds clear of the 4th placed girl, had the course been another 5m longer a Silver would have been gained. Alisha had a superb sprint finish. Alisha gained a time of 19 minutes 25 seconds just 1 second off Silver and over 2 minutes faster than her race in Salford at the Regional Championships in June. This was a fantastic achievement to gain a National Bronze Medal and a place on the podium in a super strong field. This was Winsford SC first ever National Age Group Open Water National Medal. Well Done Alisha.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

With having already qualified the 100m Breaststroke at this year’s National Youth Championships in August, this event gave Oliver the opportunity to race against potential contenders, so to impress the other swimmers in his heat, he did just that racing with a lot of determination and touched in 3rd place in a personal best of 31.59sec.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Ashley had qualified for the 400m Individual Medley, an event he will be competing in at this year’s National Youth Championships. Ashley’s national ranking in this event, is quite high, so making the final was simply a matter of swimming his heats in a reasonable time and without mistakes. With stroke strengths and weaknesses to consider, a race of this nature can be difficult to predict, it is, therefore, important for a swimmer to have four good competitive strokes and a fitness level that is extremely high to challenge the many changes they have to go through during this type of race.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The final was very exciting to watch and although Ashley had achieved a lifetime best in the heats, a final can always throw up surprises.  The pressure of performing at a high level and the expectations of winning can affect the outcome. We knew there were faster swimmers that Ashley had to compete against and if he wanted a podium place, he would need to be at his very best.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p class="style180"><strong>Conwy Whitsun, Llandudno<br></strong><span class="style220">Congratulations to all swimmers who raced in Llandudno at the Swim Conwy Meet. This must have been one of the largest teams we have ever taken to an away open meet, with over 40 swimmers taking part. It was a grueling weekend with Saturday starting at 8am and finishing at 8pm, but it was a real pleasure to see our swimmers rise to the challenge. That is what swimming and life in general is about, it is about challenging yourself and never, ever, ever giving up, no matter what. There were so many outstanding performances, too many to mention. So many Medals, PB's, and top 8 placings, but for me the most pleasure I saw was the racing and competing with other swimmers and the commitment to the racing. Racing requires guts, determination and a real character to win. Our swimmers love to race, race with fun and race without fear and that is what we all did in Llandudno. We came second top club overall, a special mention goes out to Lottie Howman (Top 9-10 year old girl) and to Jay Cushen (Top 10-11 year old boy). Thank You to all who attended and represented Winsford Swimming Club with great professionalism and thank you to all team managers and to all parents for your support.&nbsp;- Dan</span></p>

			<p class="style180"><strong>NWR Youth Champs 2014<br></strong><span class="style72">With a change of venue, Liverpool played host to the championships this year.   Winsford ASC  had a team of eight qualifying swimmers, 18 year old Alex Law, 17 year olds Callum Chapple and Amy Booth, 16 year olds Oliver Rose and Cameron Jones and 15 year olds Ashley Hogg, Brandon Sharkey and Jordan Gaskell.  They battled against the Region’s fastest swimmers and did themselves proud. Many of them gave personal best performances and some made it to the finals.<br><br><img id="RegionalYouth2014squadweb" src="Resources/regionalyouth201.jpg" alt="RegionalYouth2014squadweb"></span></p>
			<p class="style204"><span class="style72">A total of eight medals were won with 15 year old Ashley Hogg and 16 year old Oliver Rose crowned as Regional Champions in two events.  Not only did Ashley win gold in the 400m Freestyle, he also won the 1500m Freestyle, breaking the 15 year old record. Oliver followed suit by taking gold in the 50m Breaststroke. Ashley also gained silver medals in the 400m Individual Medley and 100m Butterfly with Oliver winning a bronze in the 100m Breaststroke</span>.</p>
			<p class="style204">Another great achievement was gained in the Mens 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Team.  The adrenaline kicked in and the Team fought hard to gain third place, just ahead of Liverpool.  The biggest reward to the Team is that they have earned a place at the British National Championships. Ashley and Oliver have already gained individual qualifying times to enter the British National Championships and the British Gas International Meet.</p>

			<p class="style215">The camp allowed our top-end swimmers to train twice a day in a 50m pool in warm weather for six days without a break, including gym and land base training. The level of performance that had been reached exceeded our swimmers physical and mental expectations and a total of 88.000m was covered.

			<p class="style195"><strong>Derventio Excel February Festival<br></strong><span class="style72">Winsford ASC took a small but very able team to the Derventio Excel Gala last weekend and brought home some silverware to boot. One of the Club’s rising stars, 12 year old Alisha Hawkins, was ranked first in the 200m Freestyle event and she did not disappoint.  She sailed through to victory taking her competitors by storm, gaining a gold medal as well as a personal best time.  She later followed up with a silver medal in the 400m Individual Medley.</span></p>

Fifteen year old Ashley Hogg, a consistent winn</span>er, gained silver in the 50m Breaststroke and bronze medals in the 100m Butterfly and <span class="style134">4</span>00m Freestyle.  He also clocked up three personal best times and entry into the 100m Breaststroke final. </p>
			<p class="style198">It was a momentous occasion for 12 year old Charlotte Pagett. She swam out of her skin to be rewarded with not only a personal best, but a Regional Qualifying time in the 400m Freestyle. A personal best time was also attained in the 200m Freestyle. Brandon Sharkey swam well to earn himself a spot in the 15/16 year old 100m Butterfly final. <span class="style114">Sixteen year old Oliver Rose and 18 year old Charlotte Carter also took part in this high profile gala. Some of the UK’s Olympic swimmers were competing, so just to qualify to race was an achievement.</span></p>
			<p class="style176"><span class="blue"><span class="style91"><strong>Cheshire Junior Inviation Gala<br></strong></span><span class="style45">Congratulations to Alisha Hawkins who has been selected to represent Cheshire County at the Staffordshire ASA Junior Invitation Gala at Fenton Manor Stoke on the 2nd February.

			<p class="style195"><strong>North Mid Champs Jan 14 - Medals, Medals and more Medals<br></strong><span class="style72">Over two very long, very hot and very fast weekends Winsford SC took nearly 70 swimmers to Macclesfield to race against some of the best swimmers the North midlands had to offer. The team ranged from the experienced to the very new to competition.  It was a chance for us all to put all our Christmas training into a race situation and of course in true Winsford style we were tooled up ready for war! That is the best thing about our swimmers at winsford we have the biggest hearts and biggest guts, together we were unbreakable, together we all achieved so much. </span></p>
			<p class="style198"><img id="NMidsWinsfordTeam2014web" src="Resources/nmidswinsfordtea.jpg" alt="NMidsWinsfordTeam2014web"></p>
			<p class="style198">This swimming club has had some fantastic success over the last few years but I have to say this was probably in my opinion the most successful team championships we have ever had. I don’t normally have the time or patience to count medals but I thought I would be like Carol Vorderman and do some maths! It took me fully 7 minutes to count all the medals but in the end I tallied up 120 medals! Now I don’t know what we have achieved in the past but that is an enormous amount. 120 medals!!!!!!!!! But I also did some more maths (Mr Williams my maths teacher from Sandbach School will be proud!), I worked out that the average age of the whole team was 11.98! Now I would say that is probably the youngest average age out of any club in the North Mids. We all achieved so much, so many PB’s (well over 90%), medals from all ages especially the youngsters, Regional times and some swimmers getting closer to National Times. We were all swimming so fast, with great skill and technique it was so pleasing to watch and it made me very proud of every single swimmer. <strong><span id="item8"><a href="Resources/NorthMids2014.doc">Full report</a></span></strong></p>
			<p class="style163"><strong>Derby Jan 14<br></strong><span class="style72">Winsford ASC continued their success when they sent a small team of five swimmers to Ponds Forge in Sheffield to compete in the City of Derby Long Course Meet at the weekend. The team consisted of Jessica Gallimore (18),  Alexander Law (17),  Callum Chapple (17), Oliver Rose (16) and Brandon Sharkey (15).</span></p>
			<p class="style133"><span class="style72">Once again, being a level 1 meet, the competition was attended by some of the best swimmers in the country.  This did not phase the swimmers at all as their aim, as always was to swim to the best of their ability in the hope of attaining personal best times or a coveted national qualifying time. Winning a medal of </span>course is a bonus, but not a priority. In the 50m Open Girls Backstroke, Jessica Gallimore showed off her swimming talents to the hilt.  She sailed through the race, finishing in style with a time of 31.14 seconds which is a national qualifying time. Personal best times were also gained in the 50m Freestyle, 100m Freestyle and 100m Backstroke.</p>
			<p class="style133">Callum Chapple earned a personal best in the 50m Butterfly whilst Alexander Law upped his game, attaining personal best times in the 200m Freestyle, 50m Butterfly and the 100m Butterfly. Two personal best times were gained by Oliver Rose in the 50m Breaststroke and 100m Butterfly and Brandon Sharkey pushed through to be rewarded with personal best times in the 200m Freestyle, 50m Breaststroke and the 100m Breaststroke. <span class="style114">Coach, Dave Pettengell said that he was very impressed with the level of support his team gave to each other as well as the display of team spirit and friendship.  A good weekend was had by all.</span></p>
			<p class="style163"><strong>Corby - Dec 2013<br></strong><span class="style72">Winsford swimmers travelled to Corby to take part in the very last competition of 2013. The competition was held at the 50m pool complex in Corby and was hosted by the Northampton Swimming Club. </span></p>
			<p class="style133">This was our 3rd visit to Corby and every time we have competed there, we have come away with a hat-full of medals and personal best times. Those who were taking part in this festive meet were Ashley Hogg, Alex Law, Cameron Jones, Ethan Jones, Brandon Sharkey and Callum Chapple.</p>
			<p class="style163"><span class="style114">Despite this meet having to be put back a week due to the Arena leagues being held the previous weekend, the level of competition was still tough enough to test our swimmers and for them to come away with medals and personal best times.<br><span id="item7"><a href="Resources/Corby%20report%2013.docx">Full report and placings </a></span></span></p>
			<p class="style163"><strong>Hincley Disability Gala<br></strong><span class="style114">Adam Blackburn travelled down the Leicestershire on Sunday the 8th December for the 33rd Hinckley Disability Swimming Gala , out of his three events he won 1st place in the 25m Breaststroke and freestyle and 2nd place in the 50m Breaststroke. He joined force with the Glossop Sharks for the 4 x 50m Freestyle relay where they won bronze.</span></p>
			<p class="style163"><strong>Arena A Final - Manchester 15 Dec 2013<br></strong><span class="style72">For the first time in Club history, Winsford Amateur Swimming Club achieved a place in the North West Division A final of the National Arena League which took place on Sunday 15th December at Manchester Aquatics Centre.The competing clubs were Liverpool, City of Salford, Stockport Metro, Ellesmere College Titans, Preston, Cockermouth, Warriors of Warrington and Winsford.</span></p>
			<p class="style133">Competing against seven of the biggest and best Clubs in the North West was always going to be a challenge but the Team came out fighting and determined to do their very best. Due to the size of the Club, most of the swimmers had to compete in multiple races.  However, in true Winsford style, they brushed aside any intimidation and swam through the tiredness to be the best that they could be, finishing in eighth position overall.</p>
			<p class="style133">Teamwork is an integral part of any Club and this certainly shone through on the day.  The swimmers did themselves and the Club proud and the certificate and banner presented to Club Captains James Shanley and Amy Booth will take pride of place in the trophy cabinet for all to see. To be keeping company with the calibre of those swimming clubs involved is a massive achievement which has effectively put Winsford ASC on the map as a force to be reckoned with. - Dave</p>
			<p class="style176"><span class="blue"><span class="style45">Congratulations to all swimmers who took part in this years National Arena League, rounds 1 &amp; 2 and in the A Final. This was the first time Winsford SC have ever achieved a place in the A Final against the true giants of NW and British Swimming. All swimmers raced with great determination, fight and desire. It was very pleasing to see our swimmers race and compete against the best in the region. It was a very tough gala for all clubs with so many excellent swimmers on show but I have to say it was fantastic to see Winsford SC there competing and doing so well. We finished 8th on the evening, which puts us as 8th best club in the North West out of 60 clubs who have entered the league in the NW. </span></span></p>
			<p class="style176"><span class="blue"><span class="style45">We are ranked as 3rd best club in Cheshire, only behind Stockport and Warrington and we are ranked top club in Cheshire West and Cheshire East. We have come on so much these last few years and it is thanks to Dave, all the coaches, teachers, committee and parents and most all the swimmers for all their hard work that this was all made possible. For a club our size we did fantastically well in the final, everybody should be very proud of themselves. You all made history for Winsford SC because this has never been achieved before at this swimming club. Well Done to one and all. Remember: Its not the size of the dog in the fight, its the size of the fight in the dog. - Dan Goodwin.</span></span></p>
			<p class="style163"><strong>Sheffield Snow Frills Nov 2013<br></strong><span class="style72">An elite, mean, fighting machine of 14 swimmers from Winsford SC travelled across the Pennines to compete in the Snow Frills L3 LC meet at Ponds Forge Sheffield, home of the National Championships. The spirit was very high amongst the camp and it showed in the racing. Our swimmers were on form, that was very clear to see with lots of medals, top 8 finishes and so many PB’s achieved and most of all so much experience gained racing LC.</span></p>
			<p class="style133">It was a chance to compete in a 50m pool against strong opposition. L3 LC meets are very rare, so it was an ideal opportunity for our swimmers to gain experience. We had a group of 14 swimmers taking part ranging from Callum and Cameron who have attended National Championships in the past, down to swimmers who have never raced LC before. We had a team with a range of ages and experience, so like a fine Vindaloo it was a beautiful mix of spices.</p>
			<p class="style163"><span class="style72">I do like to see the positives in all races but I have to say at this meet every swimmer performed fantastically well. Every swimmer can take a lot away from the meet. We had so many fast swims, great racing and medals. What pleased me the most though was the attitude of all swimmers, I did not hear one word of negativity it was very positive all weekend and that is why we swam and raced and performed. They say training is 90% physical, 10% mental and racing is 90% mental, 10% physical, our mentality was first class, so well done to all 14. <span id="item5"><a href="Resources/Frills%20at%20Snow%20Frills.doc">Frills full report</a></span></span></p>

The first, was when we manged to make the Premier division for the first time, but after two seasons, we found that we couldn't sustain the level of competition due to a lack of quality swimmers at the bottom end of our age group band, so I decided to pull the club out of this leagues in order to re build a team that will one day be able to compete with the best.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Going into this seasons league programme, we were expecting to have a much tougher time than we did last season, due to the big teams involved, but a great result at Blackpool, put us in a strong position going into round 2. With teams like Liverpool, Elesmere Collage and Southport taking part, our chances of making the A final looked very slim, however, never say never and when the final points were announced, we had reached over 200 which when added to the first round points total, was enough to put us into the A final and in 7th place.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

As being appointed Head coach starting next season I want to move the club forward, I want to get the best out of each and every swimmer whatever their competitive level by providing a stimulating and challenging environment. I want Winsford SC and all of our swimmers to succeed. That is why I am here today to help each swimmer to reach their goals and dreams. I honestly believe we can and will move forwards together as a team and a club, all of us working together to achieve some special things.

			<p class="style136"><strong>Conwy Autumn Open Oct 2013<br></strong><span class="style72">28 Swimmers made the journey across the border into the beautiful North Wales countryside and onto the sea side resort of Llandudno. Llandudno is a Victorian town with lovely charm and lots of places to visit, BUT we were not there for a holiday and we were not there to play all day on the slot machines and we were not there to paddle in the sea or eat fish, chips and mushy peas, we there to Swim, Race and WIN. The team was made up of all ages from Boys vice Captain Alex Law down to the youngest competitors 9 year olds Harrison Aspinall and Rory Armitt. The team however on the whole was very young, very committed and above all very, very hungry. Hunger is vital, a hunger to race, to succeed, to attack and to be brave is so important when we are in battle.</span></p>
			<p class="style199">When I arrived on pool side early on Saturday morning I just knew it was going to be a great weekend of swimming, I just knew our swimmers wanted to race. The weather was dark, cold and wet but that was good because I knew I would be indoors for most of the weekend. The meet took place at the Llandudno swimming centre a pool built for competition. There was ample space poolside, ample spectators, great scoreboard, constant 2m depth and a training pool and it close to McDonalds. It was a great place to race and a great place to watch racing. There were 6 sessions in total and a gruelling schedule with both the 800 and 1500 free part of the programme. Many of our swimmers raced a lot of events over different strokes and distances, it is so important for a young swimmers progression to race all strokes. Our swimmers gained valuable race experience, PB’s, Regional, County and North Midland QT’s. We gained a huge number of medals. It was very pleasing to see so many swimmers, swimming fast. It was clear to see that those swimmers who have put in the time into training have got the rewards. </p>
			<p class="style199">There were so many highlights and so many medals won it would be impossible to mention them all. We had success all across the weekend but the event we had huge success on was on the 200 IM for both Boys and Girls. This was an event where we had so many entries and so many new PB’s. It was great to see all our swimmers racing with skill over the 4 strokes and to see our swimmers attacking the event. This event for all our Junior and Age group swimmers is our bread and butter (or for some parents cheese!) event, the IM is so important for our swimmers development. IM, IM, IM, IM and IM that is what our youngsters dream about at night.</p>

The Club took along a team of only nineteen swimmers but they all rose to the challenge and achieved 6th place in the Top Club table and 4th place in the Top Men table – quite an achievement for a small club. This meet also gave awards for Top Male.  15 year old Ashley Hogg achieved second place and 10 year old Ethan Wright gained eighth place. There were too many brilliant performances to list all of them individually, but a special mention goes to Ethan Wright.  All his hard work paid off and he managed some substantial Personal Best performances, winning 2 gold, 2 silver and 3 bronze medals.</p>

			<p class="style136"><strong>Teaspoon Sheffield Sept 2013 - Sheffield Steel<br></strong><span class="style72">A team of 17 swimmers from Winsford Swimming club took part in the City of Sheffield, Teaspoon Sprint Meet at the tropically hot Ponds Forge. This meet is geared towards a whole range of swimmers from some who are just starting out in their careers to some who are at the top of their game and a lot more senior. Winsford SC had a very young team at Sheffield with the oldest being only 13 years old but that didn’t faze them one bit. In fact I was very impressed with the attitude, determination and most of all their fearless approach to alien territory! There were some fantastic swimmers on show (vast majority from our club) from a whole range of clubs from as far north as Dumfries to as far south as New Zealand it was a meet for all. Winsford came to race fast and that is what we all did.</span></p>
			<p class="style199">We had 17 swimmers representing Winsford in steel country and boy those swimmers were strong, very strong and I don’t mean physically so much because they are still very young and have got a lot of growing to do, I mean mentally unbreakable (it’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog). Each race getting stronger and stronger, each race more determined and each race having fun, and lots of it. Our swimmers achieved an uncountable number of PB’s, Teaspoons (for top 3 swimmers), finals and most of all Long Course racing experience and also experience of swimming heats and finals (which is rare nowadays). </p>
			<p class="style199">As always quote of the day:</p>
			<p class="style199">&quot;When I go out and race, I'm not trying to beat opponents, I'm trying to beat what I have done ... to beat myself, basically. People find that hard to believe because we've had such a bias to always strive to win things. If you win something and you haven't put everything into it, you haven't actually achieved anything at all. When you've had to work hard for something and you've got the best you can out of yourself on that given day, that's where you get satisfaction from.&quot; - Ian Thorpe</p>
			<p class="style199">Some say he eats spiders for breakfast, some say he shaves with a toothbrush, we just know he is the Stig!! Sorry as I wrote this report I was watching Top Gear on Dave channel!!!</p>
			<p class="style136 f-lp"><span class="style72">See you all at training; the more you train the better you will be.  - Dan Goodwin - <span id="item3"><a href="Resources/Sheffield%20Teaspoon%20Meet.doc">Teaspoon full report</a></span><br>&nbsp;</span></p>
